# ADK-Python Constitution

## Core Principles

### Code Quality Standards
All code contributions must adhere to established style guides and pass automated linting. Code reviews are mandatory for all changes, with a focus on maintainability, readability, and following project conventions. Complex code must be accompanied by clear documentation and comments explaining the rationale for non-obvious implementations. This ensures a consistently high standard of code quality across the entire codebase.

### Comprehensive Testing Standards
Every feature and bug fix must be accompanied by appropriate tests, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests where applicable. Test coverage thresholds must be maintained, and all tests must pass before code can be merged. Test-driven development (TDD) is encouraged where it adds value, and tests must be deterministic and maintainable. This ensures the reliability and stability of the ADK-Python framework.

### User Experience Consistency
All user-facing interfaces, APIs, and CLI commands must maintain consistency in behavior, naming conventions, and error handling. New features must follow established UX patterns and undergo review for usability. Documentation must be updated with each feature to ensure users can effectively utilize new functionality. This ensures a predictable and intuitive experience for all ADK-Python users.

### Performance Requirements
All implementations must consider performance implications, with benchmarks required for features that may impact performance. Resource usage must be optimized, with attention to CPU, memory, and network efficiency. Performance regressions are not acceptable without clear justification and approval. This ensures ADK-Python remains efficient and scalable for all use cases.

### Continuous Improvement
The development process must continuously evolve based on feedback, usage data, and emerging best practices. Regular retrospectives should identify areas for improvement in tools, processes, and documentation. Technical debt must be actively managed and addressed as part of ongoing development. This ensures the project remains modern, efficient, and aligned with user needs.

## Quality Assurance Standards

All code submissions must pass automated quality checks including linting, type checking, and security scanning. Peer code reviews are mandatory for all changes, with at least one approval required before merging. Automated testing pipelines must pass completely before any code is integrated into main branches. This ensures consistent quality across all code changes.

## Development Workflow

All feature development must follow the established branching model with clear pull request descriptions and linked issues. Changes must be small and focused to facilitate thorough review. All documentation must be updated alongside code changes. This ensures a streamlined and accountable development process.

## Governance

This constitution governs all development practices within the ADK-Python project. All team members must be familiar with these principles and ensure their work aligns with them. Amendments to this constitution require documented justification, team discussion, and approval from project maintainers. Version updates must be communicated to all contributors.
